An aspiring web developer!

For once, I'd love to have a career in which I can be proud of my work!
You know what you're capable of. And you know how to go about self learning.

I'm hoping you'll look back on your first commit with pride knowing that you've made it as far as you did now.
Keep at it! Don't give up!
